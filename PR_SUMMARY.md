# PR Summary — refactor/extract-runtime-export-shims

This PR extracts presentation-only UI from `demo/sections` into the canonical `ui/` layer and replaces the original demo implementations with shim re-exports to preserve the demo import surface.

## Extracted UI components (low-risk)
- `ui/ThemeControls` (earlier)
- `ui/ThemePreview` (earlier)
- `ui/story/*` components (StoryToolbar, StorySidebar, StoryEditor, StoryPreview, StoryLogicView)
- `ui/sections/inputs/*` : BasicInputs, SpecializedInputs, ValidationForm, InputsSection
- `ui/sections/LayoutSection`, `MockupSection`, `MarketingSection`, `NavigationSection`
- `ui/sections/CompositeSection`
- `ui/sections/StatusSection`
- `ui/sections/data-display/*` : AccordionAndDiff, AvatarsAndBadges, ChatAndTimeline, CountdownAndKbd, StatsDisplay
- `ui/sections/TablesSection`
- `ui/sections/CarouselSection`

## Validation & Status
- Shim purity: Passed (scripts/check-shim-purity.sh) — no runtime imports from `demo/` were introduced.
- CI: `check-shim-purity` passed on branch; Contract checks remain pre-existing and are deferred to a dedicated docs PR.

## Skipped (higher risk, paused)
- `FeedbackSection` — contains semantics (alerts, progress, skeletons, toasts) and may couple with runtime or export logic.
- Interactive / headless components (Controllers, store-bound UI) — deferred for separate classification.

## Next Steps
1. Open/update the PR with this summary and request review. (This file is the PR-ready summary.)
2. Upon approval, continue extracting the next tranche (Feedback/interactive) only after classification.
3. Final demo isolation sweep + CI `tsc` and contract remediation in separate PRs.
