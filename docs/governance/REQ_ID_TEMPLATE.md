This governance note is a pointer to the canonical REQ template in the Contracts directory.

- See [docs/CONTRACTS/REQ_ID_TEMPLATE.md](docs/CONTRACTS/REQ_ID_TEMPLATE.md)

The governance folder should not contain contract-grade normative text. If you need a template or an example REQ, place it under `docs/CONTRACTS` instead.
