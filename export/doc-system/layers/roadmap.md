# Roadmap / Narrative Layer — Intent & Direction

## Role
Explain planning, motivation, and dependencies before the work reaches contract quality.

## Document set
- `docs/roadmap/*.md`
- `docs/prd/*.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/TECH_DEBT.md`, `docs/HARD_PROBLEMS.md` for context and inventories.

## Guidelines
- Stay descriptive; mark everything as “pending contracts” if it uses normative language.
- Link to spec candidates and proposed `REQ` IDs, but treat them as invitations for the contract layer to formalize.
- Identify blockers, tooling needs, and the path to TDD before declaring a feature ready.
