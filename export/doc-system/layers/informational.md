# Informational Layer — Understanding & Onboarding

## Role
Provide context, mental models, and onboarding guidance without imposing obligations.

## Document set
- `docs/MENTAL_MODEL.md`
- `docs/philosophy/*.md`
- `docs/HARD_PROBLEMS.md`
- `docs/review/*` when they carry guidelines or retrospectives (for example, GAIS instructions).
- READMEs such as `README_GAIS.md`.
- Execution notes like `todo.md` when they describe ongoing work rather than rules.

## Guidelines
- No `REQ` blocks; no normative statements that block code.
- Safe for tutorial-style content, storyboards, or risk logs.
- Use this layer to explain naming, invariants, and how to think about the builder.
